The script requires that the following files are present in the directory from which the script is executed:  features.txt, X_train.txt, y_train.txt, subject_train.txt, X_test.txt, y_test.txt,  and subject_train.txt.  The only output created by the script is the tidy data set, tidyData.txt.

The script is liberally commented to explain each step during execution.
